# spain-graph-navigator

A simple AI agent code was implemented, where an agent navigates between Spanish cities using graph-based search algorithms.

Features:
- Represents 20 Spanish cities as nodes in a graph.
- Uses geopy + Nominatim to fetch latitudes and longitudes.
- Implements Informed Search algorithms for path finding (Uniform Cost   Search and A*).
- Visualize the graph of cities with lat-long converted to Cartesian coordinates.

Dataset:
- Correlation matrix, which stores distances between cities.
- Coordinates(lat-long), which are fetched using geopy.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Geopy
